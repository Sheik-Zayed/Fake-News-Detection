# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Fake news has become a critical issue in the digital era, spreading misinformation and influencing public opinion. This project aims to build an automated system that detects fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

# 🔍 Project Overview

Domain: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning

Goal: Classify news articles as Real or Fake

Dataset: 20,000+ labeled news articles (real/fake)

Algorithms Used:

TF-IDF + Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Transformer-based model BERT

Deployment: Streamlit Web App

# ⚙️ Features

Preprocesses and cleans news articles (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal)

Trains models using TF-IDF + SVM and fine-tuned BERT

Achieves 95% accuracy with BERT

Provides a Streamlit-based web app for real-time predictions

Simple, user-friendly interface: input news → output prediction (Real/Fake)

# 📊 Results

SVM (TF-IDF features): ~91% Accuracy

BERT (Transformer model): ~95% Accuracy

Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score all around 95%

# 🚀 Future Scope

Extend support to multiple languages

Integration with live news APIs for real-time detection

Browser extension / mobile app for instant news credibility check

Hybrid model combining deep learning and traditional ML for better robustness

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, Pandas, NumPy

Frameworks: Streamlit (for deployment)

Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
